$openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c <len> %% -c 12 used as example


Openssl random string generator. Different command parts are explained bellow:

1. `openssl rand -base64 32`: This part of the command uses the OpenSSL tool to generate random data. Here's what each part does:

   - `openssl`: This is the command to invoke the OpenSSL tool, which is commonly used for secure communication and cryptographic operations.
   - `rand`: This is a subcommand of OpenSSL used for generating random data.
   - `-base64`: This option specifies that the output should be encoded in Base64 format.
   - `32`: This argument specifies the number of bytes of random data to generate. In this case, it's generating 32 bytes of random data.

   So, this part of the command generates 32 random bytes and encodes them in Base64 format.

2. `|`: This is a pipe symbol, and it's used to take the output of the previous command and feed it as input to the next command.

3. `tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9'`: This part of the command uses the `tr` command to perform character translation and deletion. Here's what each part does:

   - `tr`: This is the command for character translation.
   - `-dc`: These are options for `tr`. 
     - `-d` stands for "delete," which means it will delete characters.
     - `-c` stands for "complement," which means it will complement the set of characters specified.

   - `'a-zA-Z0-9'`: This is the set of characters specified for the translation. It includes all lowercase letters (a-z), all uppercase letters (A-Z), and all digits (0-9).

   So, this part of the command takes the Base64-encoded random data generated in the previous step and deletes all characters that are not alphanumeric. This effectively leaves only alphanumeric characters in the output.

4. `head -c 12`: This part of the command uses the `head` command to limit the output to the first 12 characters. Here's what each part does:

   - `head`: This is the command used to display the beginning of a file or, in this case, the beginning of the input stream.
   - `-c 12`: This option tells `head` to output only the first 12 characters of the input.

   So, this part of the command takes the alphanumeric string generated in the previous step and limits it to the first 12 characters.

In summary, the entire command generates a random string of 12 alphanumeric characters by first generating 32 random bytes, encoding them in Base64, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and finally selecting the first 12 characters from the resulting string. This is often used in scripting or automation when you need a random string for various purposes, such as generating passwords or cryptographic keys.

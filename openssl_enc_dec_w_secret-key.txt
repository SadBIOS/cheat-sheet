To encrypt and decrypt a file using OpenSSL with a secret binary key file, you can use symmetric encryption, where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. Here are the steps for encryption and decryption:

Encryption:

1. Generate a secret key or use an existing one. You can generate a random key and save it to a binary file using OpenSSL:
	openssl rand -out secret_key.bin 32
	
    In this example, a 256-bit (32-byte) random key is generated and saved to secret_key.bin.

2. Encrypt a file using the generated secret key:
	openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.bin -pass file:secret_key.bin

   Replace plaintext.txt with the name of the file you want to encrypt. This command uses AES-256 in CBC mode for encryption and the secret key from secret_key.bin.



Decryption:

1. Decrypt the encrypted file using the same secret key:
	openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted.bin -out decrypted.txt -pass file:secret_key.bin

   This command decrypts the encrypted.bin file and saves the result to decrypted.txt.


Now, you have successfully encrypted and decrypted a file using OpenSSL with a secret binary key file (secret_key.bin). Make sure to keep the secret key secure, as it's essential for both encryption and decryption. You can securely share the encrypted file with others and provide them with the secret key separately for decryption.
